# Tanzania_Pump_Project
This repository contains the data preparation and modeling for the "Pump it Up" DrivenData competition, where I scored in the top 15% out of over 7,000 entries

I have included a PDF for my visualizations, the EDA for the data, and the modeling for the competition in this repository. This was 
my first competition ever as a data scientist, and I think that it provided a great foundation for using tools such as nested cross
validation. I think I would do a few things differently looking back on it, but it was my first baby, so it holds a special place in my 
mind ha. Hope you enjoy looking it over if you ever find yourself here. My email is fultoncannon@gmail.com if you ever want to touch base
about anything.

Best, 

Sam
